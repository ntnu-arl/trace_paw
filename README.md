### Introduction
TRACEPaw is a compact and sensorized paw for legged robots, utilizing silicon deformation, an embedded micro camera, and a microphone to estimate 3D force vectors and recognize terrain types in real-time, helping the robot to adapt their locomotion strategies.
This repository serves as the central hub for the TRACEPaw, containing the source code, documentation, and additional supporting materials.

### Documentation
The [Wiki](https://github.com/ntnu-arl/trace_paw/wiki) is the primary source of documentation for TRACEPaw. It contains comprehensive information on the following topics:
- Mechanical Design & Electronics: Comprises CAD files, assembly instructions, and manufacturing guidelines, along with a comprehensive list of electronic components needed for TRACEPaw.
- Software Setup: Guide to set up the software environment for TRACEPaw, including instructions on data collection, model training & visualization, and the deployment process.
- Training and test datasets for the vision-based force estimation and audio-based terrain classification capabilities of TRACEPaw.
